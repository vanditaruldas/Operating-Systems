# Operating-Systems
CSE 521 is an introductory course on the design and implementation of operating systems. It will focus on different OS design techniques, process management, processor scheduling, concurrent programming, deadlocks and synchronization, memory management, file management and I/O systems, disk scheduling, protection and security, and distributed systems. The course will include hands-on programming projects on different OS components. 

There will be two hands-on programming projects throughout the course. These projects will aim to implement some core Operating System components at the kernel-level for better understanding of the concepts.

Both projects will be based on Pintos operating system. Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture developed at Stanford University.
